# 🐍 Python Data Structures – Exercises Checkpoint

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python exercises designed to strengthen programming skills through practical manipulation of data structures and implementation of fundamental algorithms. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of Python programming, from basic list operations to more complex dictionary manipulations and sorting techniques.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Develop proficiency in Python's built-in data structures
- Implement and apply fundamental algorithms
- Practice problem-solving with real-world coding scenarios
- Enhance understanding of Python functions and methods
- Build confidence in data manipulation and transformation

All solutions are implemented inside the notebook :
